All speakers, hosts and participants are expected to follow our Code of Conduct: https://github.com/stockholm-react-js/governance/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

It is especially important for speakers to make sure that their content follow these guidelines. *Please be extra mindful about what jokes you include and about your graphic elements.*

If you experience any behaviour before, during or after the event that violates our CoC, please let us know in person or online, we are here to help!

Speakers are encouraged but not required to show up a bit earlier to set up and make sure the presentation is working as intended.

For main talks we usually do not enforce time slots rigorously. Exceptions are made if talks are running very long or if the event schedule requires it so aim to stick to your allotted time.

For lightning talks we usually try to enforce time slots semi-rigorously. Keep them to 10 minutes and be prepared to quickly conclude the talk if you happen to run over time (we will always give you a minute to finish up).

We hope this answers some of the questions you might have had, donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch if something went unanswered or if we can help in any way.

**All the best,**
